# hello-world
My very first repository :)
Hi, my name is Payal Singh and I'm a senior attending Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School.
I'm interested in studying Psychology, and I plan on becoming a therapist when I get older. 
I'm currently learning Javascript and Jquery in my Web Design class.
Stay in touch with me via email! My email is psin2410@taehs.org
